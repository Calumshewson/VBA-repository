Calum Hewson submitting HW2 VBA Challenge

I have attached both the original excel files that include my solutions to the challenge
The alphabetical testing files are there so you can see my build up toward the final solution

bas files of both excel files are also included to read the VBA scripts directly

Finally screenshots have been included of the final master script, as well as starting outputs for each quarter of stock data
